title: Requirements for ”The Ultimate Travel Bag“

For a while now I've had a board on Pinterest called <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/larsbarkman/the-ultimate-travel-bag/" target="_blank">The Ultimate Travel Bag</a> where I've collected images of what I believe is the characteristics of the ultimate travel bag, but what exactly am I looking for in a bag for?!

**Note!** There are times when I would have get a different bag than this (i.e. when I go skiing) but for all business and "normal vacations" (i.e. City trips, beach trips, hiking without tent) this bag would be the one that I use.

These are features that I require:

- Accepted as carry-on for all international and domestic airlines worldwide (see blog post: <a href="http://larsbarkman.com/2015/06/08/the-carry-on-restrictions/" target="_blank">Carry-on Restrictions</a> )
- Rugged enough to withstand year in and year out of daily use
- A style that blends in for both business and "normal vacations"
- Can be comfortably carried as a backpack for an extended time
- "Waterproof", not if submerged but it should be able to i.e. be dropped in the sea or lay outside in heavy rain and stay there for some time without the internal compartments getting wet
- Possibility to bring two regular water bottles even when fully loaded
- Safe from unauthorised access (pickpockets) while carrying it on the back
- Removable/changeable patch
- Possibility to append any number of items to the outside bag
- Weight under 1 kg
