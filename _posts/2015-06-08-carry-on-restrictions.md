In trying to find or design the <a href="http://larsbarkman.com/2015/06/08/the-ultimate-travel-bag/" target="_blank">The Ultimate Travel Bag</a> I have stated that it should be "Accepted as carry-on for all airlines worldwide" but what does mean in actual size and weight?

**_Disclaimer!!_** The information that I present here is to the best of my knowledge correct, but always double check with your airline before the trip. Furthermore, I don't cover some really small aircraft due to the fact that they might not allow any carry-on baggage at all.

**Note!** No individual measurement might be bigger than stated (total length does not apply anymore for many airlines), wheels and handles are included in the measurements.

**Maximum allowed size and weight (wheels and handles included): 45 cm x 34 cm x 20 cm, 4 kg**


Weight is IMHO the toughest restriction due to the fact that a rugged bag in it self will probably weight &gt;500g.

Data that was the foundation for the above Carry-on restrictions.

**Size:**

- **20 cm** x 35 cm x **45 cm**
  - Japan Airlines (Domestic), <a href="https://www.jal.co.jp/en/dom/service/bags/carry.html">Link</a></li>
- 48 cm x **34 cm** x 23 cm
  - Virgin Australia (Domestic), <a href="http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/plan/baggage/carry-on-baggage/">Link</a></li>

**Weight:**

- **4 Kg** (extreme restriction, more "normal" would be 5 Kg)
  - Qantas (domestic), <a href="http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/carry-on-baggage/global/en#carry-on-baggage-allowances">Link</a></li>
