title: Building a Reasonably Priced HTPC: Overview
---

## Why a HTPC?
- Netflix, HBO, SVT Play and YouTube is the normal way for the family to watch video these days and apps in e.g. Smart tv's or Apple TV are not always present or reliable
- When we (very seldom) rent a movie it's always via streaming and those sites donÂ´t always have apps
- Some legacy sites still require Flash for video
- I want to be able to play our old dvd's and blu-rays
- Last but not least... It's more fun to build then to buy!

## Requirements
- Very quite
- Even though it's a HTPC I want to be able to handle some popular games e.g. Minecraft, GTA
- Be able to run windows (due to the availability of games and restrictions from Netflix)
- Be able to fit into and "survive" (heat) in the TV stand
- Should look good in the living room
- Connect via HDMI to a TV running 1080p
- Support 5.1 audio via HDMI
- Blu-ray player
- Maximum budget of 10.000 SEK (ca. 1.100$)
