title: Building a Reasonably Priced HTPC: Quite
---

## Why a HTPC?
- Netflix, HBO, SVT Play and YouTube is the normal way for the family to watch video these days and apps in e.g. Smart tv's or Apple TV are not always present or reliable
- When we (very seldom) rent a movie it's always via streaming and those sites donÂ´t always have apps
- Some legacy sites still require Flash for video
- I want to be able to play our old dvd's and blu-rays
- Last but not least... It's more fun to build then to buy!

## Requirements
- Very quite
- Connect via HDMI to a TV running 1080p
- Support 5.1 audio via HDMI
- Even though it's a HTPC I want to be able to handle some popular games e.g. Minecraft, GTA
- Be able to run windows (due to the availability of games and restrictions from Netflix)
- Blu-ray player
- Should look good in the living room
- Be able to fit into and "survive" (heat) in the TV stand
- The bulk storage should be on a NAS or online
- Maximum budget of 10.000 SEK (ca. 1.100$)

## Critical success factors
- How to build a quite PC?
- What is required to handle e.g. Minecraft and GTA?


## Less heat = Less need for cooling = Less need for fans = Less noice
The key to building a quiet HTPC is to use low power parts which generate less heat and thus require less cooling.

Some advice I've picked up on the web for keeping down the heat:
- The smaller the case, the more difficult it is to get a proper airflow
- Choose a low TDP CPU
- Inefficient PSU generates more heat, so get a 80Plus certified PSU
- Choose a SSD disk
- Integrated GPU generate a lot less heat then a graphics cards (not realistic in this case)
- Use RAM memory modules with a heat spreader

## Parts needed
- Motherboard
- Graphics card 
- CPU
- CPU Cooler
- Case
- Power supply 
- Memory
- Storage
- Blu-ray player
- Keyboard and mouse
- Cables and stuff
