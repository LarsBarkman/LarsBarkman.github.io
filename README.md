My site
========

These are the underlying technologies of my very minimalistic blog.

**Custom Domain:** [larsbarkman.com](http://larsbarkman.com/)  
**Hosting:** [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)  
**Site Generator:** [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)  
**Theme:** [Scribble] (https://github.com/muan/scribble/)  

Except for the basic configuration, the only modification that I've made to Scribble is changing the color of blockquotes to get them to "pop out" a little bit more.

If you think that there is something I missedÂ or just want to get in touch, please contact me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/larsbarkman" target="_blank">@larsbarkman</a>
