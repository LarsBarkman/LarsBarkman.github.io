title: Building a Reasonably Priced HTPC â€“ Quite
---

###*The key to building a quiet HTPC is to use low power parts which generate less heat and thus require less cooling leading to less noice.*

####I've read about many HTPC that make due with passiv cooling but they don't have the requirements that I do:
- The CPU I need for Minecraft requires active cooling
- They use the built in graphics in the CPU and that won't be enough for my gaming requirements

####Some recommendations I've picked up on the web for keeping down the heat:
- The smaller the case, the more difficult it is to get a proper airflow
- Choose a low TDP CPU
- Inefficient PSU generates more heat, so get a 80Plus certified PSU
- Choose a SSD disk
- Integrated GPU generate a lot less heat then a graphics cards (not realistic in this case)
- Use RAM memory modules with a heat spreader

####Other areas of importans:
- Large fans can operate on lower rpm and therefore create less noice
- SSD don't make sounds like a HDD
- A more solid case won't have the same type of vibrations as a more "flimsy" case

The next post will look into what is required to handle e.g. Minecraft and GTA?
