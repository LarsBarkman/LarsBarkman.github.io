##What is required to handle e.g. Minecraft and GTA?

###GTA 5

####From Rockstar's [site](http://www.rockstargames.com/V/info/pc/specs) I get the following recommendations:
- OS: Windows 8.1 64 Bit, Windows 8 64 Bit or Windows 7 64 Bit Service Pack 1
- Processor: Intel Core i5 3470 @ 3.2GHz or AMD X8 FX-8350 @ 4GHz
- Memory: 8GB
- Video Card: NVIDIA GTX 660 2GB or AMD HD 7870 2GB
- Sound Card: 100% DirectX 10 compatible
- HDD: 65GB 

###Minecraft
####From Mojangs's [site](https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/325948-minecraft-system-requirements) I get the following recommendations:
- CPU: Intel Core i3 or AMD Athlon II (K10) 2.8 GHz
- RAM: 4GB
- GPU: GeForce 2xx Series or AMD Radeon HD 5xxx Series (Excluding Integrated Chipsets) with OpenGL 3.3
- HDD: 1GB

###Some findings:
- It comes as no supprise that GTA 5 have much harder requirements but at the same time GTA is known for requiring fairly reasonable hardware so it should be reasonable to assume that the specs for GTA is a level to aim for even though it might not be enough for serious racing games like Project CARS.
- From what I have heard is it more important for Minecraft to have higher hz in the CPU than multiple cores.
- Windows adds another 20GB (64-bit) HDD requirement.

###Summary of requirements (minimum):
- Windows 8.1 64 Bit
- Processor: 4 cores @ 3.2 ghz
- Memory: 8GB
- Video Card: 2 GB upper mid market
- HDD: 200 GB, SSD is more or less standard
