title: Building a Reasonably Priced HTPC – Introduction
---

## What is a Home Theater PC (HTPC)?
>A home theater PC (HTPC) or media center computer is a convergence device that combines some or all the capabilities of a personal computer with a software application that supports video, photo, audio playback, and sometimes video recording functionality.  
>– [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_theater_PC)

## Why a HTPC?
- Netflix, HBO, SVT Play and YouTube is the normal way for the family to watch video these days and apps in e.g. Smart TV's or Apple TV are not always present or reliable
- When we (very seldom) rent a movie it's always via streaming and those sites don´t always have apps
- We want to watch the above mentioned channels on the regular TV
- We are tired of connecting the laptop to the TV
- Some legacy sites still require Flash for video
- I want to be able to play our old dvd's and blu-rays
- Last but not least... It's more fun to build then to buy!

## Requirements
- Very quite
- Even though it's a HTPC I want to be able to handle some popular games e.g. Minecraft, GTA
- Be able to run windows (due to the availability of games and restrictions from Netflix)
- Be able to fit into and "survive" (heat) in the TV stand
- Should look good in the living room
- Connect via HDMI to a TV running 1080p
- Support 5.1 audio via HDMI
- Blu-ray player
- Maximum budget of 10.000 SEK (ca. 1.100$)

- Graphics card 
- CPU
- CPU Cooler
- Case
- Power supply 
- Memory
- Storage
- Blu-ray player
- Keyboard and mouse
- Cables and stuff

## Execution

In the upcoming posts I'll go through each section...

The next post will look into how to build a quite PC.
