title: Building a Reasonably Priced HTPC â€“ Graphics card
---

We know from previous post that GTA is the level we aim for and that the requirement is a graphics card with 2 GB in the upper mid market.

After googling a bit I found this [test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1Ai8-daW1U) of graphics cards for GTA 5 and from that I conclude that Nvidia Geforce GTX 960 should do fine for 1080p at 144hz, but what actual card should I get?

I found [this test of Asus, Gigabyte and MSI (in Swedish)](http://www.sweclockers.com/test/19925-geforce-gtx-960-fran-asus-gigabyte-och-msi) and from that I conclude that MSI is the card that have the best cooling and therefore the least noise which is a big plus for a HTPC setup.

After doing some more reading I've come to the conclusion that MSI Geforce GTX 960 Gaming 2G OC is pretty good, very quite but on the negative side it's a bit pricey (but I'm willing to pay that for the lower noise).

I choose: **MSI Geforce GTX 960 Gaming 2G OC**
