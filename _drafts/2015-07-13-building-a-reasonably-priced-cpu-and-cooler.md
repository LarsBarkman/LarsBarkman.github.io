title: Building a Reasonably Priced HTPC â€“ CPU & CPU Cooler
---

##CPU
We know from previous post that GTA 5 is the level we aim for and that the requirement is 4 cores @ 3.2 ghz. 
I also know that to keep the heat down I should choose a low TDP CPU.

Due to the extreme voltage AMD has for it's CPU's and the fact that intel seem to win most tests I've only looked at intel CPU's.

After looking around I found this [test](http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-pc-gaming-cpus-processors/) where I5 4690K was named the best gaming processor, but looking at the power consumtion I wonder if it might not be wise to look at the 4690T to get less heat and thus a more quite PC?

GTA 5 has a i5-3470 as a recommended CPU so let's compare that with the 4690T to see the [difference](http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Core-i5-4690T-vs-Intel-Core-i5-3470). AS we can see is there almost no difference and I therefore conclude that the i5-4690T should be able to do the job.

I choose: **Intel Core i5-4690T Processor**

##CPU Cooler

Due to the fact that the graphics card is pretty high I'm not that worried that the cooler will create any serious problems so I'm going to try to find a good and quite cooler and don't care about the size until I've choosen a chassi but I might have to rethink the choise at that point.

I belive that 4690T with it's low TDP could cope with a fanless cooler.
